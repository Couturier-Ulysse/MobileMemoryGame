**Introduction**

This repository consists on a mobile application for Android made on Android Studio. It is a simple memory game with four menus : main menu, race against time, no error mode, scoreboard. 

New features should be added later and this is the first version.

**How to get it**

1- Install Android Studio and follow the setup.

2- Download the repository.

3- Open the project on your Android Studio software (version I used : Giraffe version).

4- I advise to plug an android phone in USB and not to use a virtual one.
